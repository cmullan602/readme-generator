## Description

I created this project for my unit 9 challenge in coding bootcamp. For the challenge we were given starting code to refractor and develop into a fully functioning readme generator. I actually created this readme using the readme generator! I found the challenge difficult at first but it really came to me quickly and I'm happy with the finished project.
